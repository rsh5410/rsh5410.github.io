Seung Hyun Ryu is a graduate student of neuroscience at the Seoul National University. He entered the Laboratory of Neural Functions and Bio-imaging with an interest in neural mechanisms and neurophysiology. His current research interests include finding presynaptic trafficking mechanisms and presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP).

He is a co-author of two journal papers–PNAS and Mol Brain(~2021)– and a recipient of many honors and awards, including the Research Grant of Basic Science Research Program(2022-2023). He was also a teaching assistant in General physics(2017), Seminars in neuroscience 1(2022), and Principles of neurosciences 1(2022).

He likes to talk and discuss with all neuro-folks. Glad to see you on this site!
