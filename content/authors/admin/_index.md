Seung Hyun Ryu is a graduate student of neuroscience at the Seoul National University. He entered the Laboratory of Neural Functions and Bio-imaging with an interest in neural mechanisms and neurophysiology. His current research interests include finding presynaptic trafficking mechanisms and presynaptic homeostatic plasticity.

He is a co-author of two journal papers–PNAS and Mol Brain(~2021)– and a recipient of many honors and awards, including the Research Grant of Basic Science Research Program(2022). He was also a teaching assistant in General physics(2017), Seminars in neuroscience 1(2022), and Principles of neurosciences 1(2022).

He likes to talk and discuss with all neuro folks. Glad to see you on this site.
