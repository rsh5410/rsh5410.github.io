We recently found that NHE6 directly interacts with secretory carrier membrane protein 5 (SCAMP5), and SCAMP5-dependent recruitment of NHE6 to SVs controls the strength of synaptic transmission by modulation of quantal size of glutamate release at rest. It is, however, unknown whether NHE6 recruitment by SCAMP5 plays a role during synaptic plasticity. Here, we found that the number of NHE6-positive presynaptic boutons was significantly increased by the chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). Since cLTP involves new synapse formation, our results indicated that NHE6 was recruited not only to the existing presynaptic boutons but also to the newly formed presynaptic boutons. Knock down of SCAMP5 completely abrogated the enhancement of NHE6 recruitment by cLTP. Interestingly, despite an increase in the number of NHE6-positive boutons by cLTP, the quantal size of glutamate release at the presynaptic terminals remained unaltered. Together with our recent results, our findings indicate that SCAMP5-dependent recruitment of NHE6 plays a critical role in manifesting presynaptic efficacy not only at rest but also during synaptic plasticity. Since both are autism candidate genes, reduced presynaptic efficacy by interfering with their interaction may underlie the molecular mechanism of synaptic dysfunction observed in autism.","tags":[],"title":"SCAMP5 mediates activity-dependent enhancement of NHE6 recruitment to synaptic vesicles during synaptic plasticity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Unghwi Lee","Chunghon Choi","Seung Hyun Ryu","Daehun Park","Sang-Eun Lee","Kitae Kim","Yujin Kim","Sunghoe Chang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Thus, proper localization of NHE6 is critical for determining synaptic strength at gluta- matergic synapses, but the underlying mechanism remains un- known. We found that an SV-enriched protein, SCAMP5, is a key determinant for axonal trafficking and synaptic localization of NHE6. By perturbing their interaction, NHE6 fails to be localized at synaptic sites, resulting in hyperacidification of the SV lumen and a significant reduction in the quantal size of glutamate re- leased. Since both are autism candidate genes, our results sug- gest that impaired interaction between two proteins could relate to the synaptic dysfunction observed in autism.","tags":[],"title":"SCAMP5 plays a critical role in axonal trafficking and synaptic localization of NHE6 to adjust quantal size at glutamatergic synapses","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
